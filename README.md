# Hyperboid's Tiled extensions

To install, just copy the .js files you want into [the appropriate directory](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/scripting/#scripted-extensions).

## KristalLayers

Adds a keybind + menu item to create object layers that Kristal can use.

## SKMEFormat

Import/Export support for the Lua format used by the [Stupid Kristal Map Editor](https://github.com/Hyperboid/skme).

Lacks support for several Tiled features (particularly those that SKME doesn't
have an analogue for). Notabe examples include group layers, image layers, and
layer offsets.
